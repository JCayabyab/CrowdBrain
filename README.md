# MERN Starter by Jay Jay Cayabyab

This repository includes a boilerplate application that is designed as a launchpad for initializing boilerplate applications.

The structure of the project in its current state assumes that the project will have two separate servers: one for the server-side and one for the client side.

### To customize for your project:
- 

**This starter installs the following dependencies:**
Server-side:
- Express
- Nodemon
- Concurrently

**Client-side:**
- create-react-app dependencies
- Redux
- React-Redux
- Redux-Form
- Redux-Thunk

**This starter automatically completes the following steps:**
- Creates a separate npm directory in the `/client` directory.
- Creates an Express app in index.js.
- Formats the package.json file:
   - Adds the *node* and *npm* engines.
